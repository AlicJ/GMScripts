GMScripts
=========

Scripts I wrote for Grease Monkey on Firefox that make my life easier.


How to install
=========
FireFox
---------
Tested with FireFox 34.0.5, but the version should not matter
1. Install GreaseMonkey Add-on (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/）
2. Download the js file you want (not the jQuery ones)
3. Drag them onto your browser
4. Enjoy!

Chrome 
---------
Not all files are tested. Should probably all work though. Tell me if they don't
1. Install TemperMonkey Add-on (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en）
2. Download the js file you want (not the jQuery ones)
3. Drag them onto your browser
4. Enjoy!

Safari
--------
Not tested, since I don't own a Mac
1. Download GreaseKit for Mac (http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/20718/greasekit)
2. Not sure how to install js on that, follow their instructions
3. Tell me if anything doesn't work


Internet Explorer
--------
1. It is a joke.
2. Switch to a browser mentioned above
